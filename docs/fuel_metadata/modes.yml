ha_compact: {description: 'This configuration Deploys OpenStack ready for high availability
    (HA). Controller services are prepared for HA by setting up a base MySQL/Galera,
    RabbitMQ and HAProxy so that additional controllers can be deployed NOW, or scaled
    out LATER. 3 or more controllers are required for a true HA environment.'}
